This was a game I made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2020.1 in February 2020.

You're welcome to look at the source code but...

Keep in mind this game was made in SEVEN days for a game jam and so code quality was the furthest thing on my mind.

The source code is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE and I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYBODY learn from this codebase. It was spaghetti from front to back BUT if you're interested in taking a peek, go ahead but YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

There's also a bunch of stuff in there I never bothered to use like Crab, Turtle, and the redux state management folder.
  
Good luck and godspeed.
